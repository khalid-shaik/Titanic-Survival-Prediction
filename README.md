🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers using a Logistic Regression model. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualizations to interpret the results.

📚 Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as class, age, gender, and other relevant factors.

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Goal: Build a classification model to predict survival.
Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
📊 Dataset Information
The dataset includes two files:

train.csv - Original training dataset used for model training.
test.csv - Test dataset used for predictions.
Key Features:
Pclass - Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Age - Age of the passenger
SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch - Number of parents/children aboard
Fare - Passenger fare
Sex - Gender (encoded as male/female)
Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)
