# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers using a Logistic Regression model. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualizations to interpret the results.

## 📚 **Project Overview**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as class, age, gender, and other relevant factors.

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Goal:** Build a classification model to predict survival.
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 📊 **Dataset Information**
- `train.csv` - Original training dataset used for model training.
- `test.csv` - Test dataset used for predictions.
- Key features include:
  - `Pclass` - Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - `Age` - Age of the passenger
  - `SibSp` - Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch` - Number of parents/children aboard
  - `Fare` - Passenger fare
  - `Sex` - Gender (encoded as male/female)
  - `Embarked` - Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)
