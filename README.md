# **ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Data Science & Machine Learning**
 
This project leverages Data Science techniques and Machine Learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The workflow encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to derive insightful predictions and assess model performance.

## **ðŸ“š Project Overview**
Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical data.

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression (Classification Model)

Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Objective: Identify patterns in passenger profiles that influenced survival.

## **ðŸ”Ž Dataset Information**
The dataset contains two files:

train.csv - Used for training and validating the model.

test.csv - Used for making predictions and evaluating model performance.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:**
Pclass - Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Age - Age of the passenger
SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch - Number of parents/children aboard
Fare - Passenger fare
Sex - Gender (encoded as male/female)
Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)
