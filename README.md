# **ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Data Science & Machine Learning**
 
This project leverages Data Science techniques and Machine Learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The workflow encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to derive insightful predictions and assess model performance.

## **ðŸ“š Project Overview**
Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical data.\n
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression (Classification Model)\n
Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset\n
Objective: Identify patterns in passenger profiles that influenced survival.
